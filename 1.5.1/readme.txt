Description
===========

Tiny Forge theme encompass all the best features of the default WordPress themes in one place, plus more usability and code improvements!

It features elegant mobile-first HTML5 ready structure of Twenty Twelve, custom per-post headers and three footer widgets from Twenty Eleven
(plus forth footer widget to insert your copyright information), icon webfont support from Twenty Thirteen, Google Fonts support and Schema.org microdata format support.
It's all there, you have everything in one neat package. Also you can upload your custom Header Logo to display it next to Site Title and Description.

Along with the main theme you will find an example of a child theme - an easy way to start developing with child themes! Tiny Forge can be used as 
a learning tool or your own little web development "framework". 

With its unique "Coding Tips system" Tiny Forge helps to understand how to extend parent themes and build your own child themes, hacking them the way you want it. 
You get the best coding examples from default WordPress themes and the best hacks from the child theme.

Attention Tiny Forge translators! Tiny Forge is based on Twenty Twelve code. If you want to prepare a translation for your language, 
use Tiny Forge POT file and as a reference for the translation of text strings use Twenty Twelve translation POT file.

Quick start guide
=================

1. To make it easy for you to change the look of your website and to retain the ability to update Tiny Forge theme, I recommend using Tiny Forge as a parent theme. 
New WordPress users do not know how to create a child theme, so for that purpose I included an example of Tiny Forge child theme (inc/tinyforge-child-theme-example.zip). 
Unzip that file and upload this child theme as a separate theme alongside with Tiny Forge parent theme. Activate Child theme and you're ready to go! From that point 
all of your changes will be done in the child theme. If you need to modify a file, but it isn't present in your child theme folder, just copy it there from the Tiny Forge theme. 
As bonus Tiny Forge child theme has very nice search field in the top menu area (ported from Twenty Thirteen theme) and two new header images to give you an example on how 
to change the default header images in the child theme.

Read more about child themes:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes

2. In WordPress Admin panel go to Appearance/Widgets, 
expand Footer Copyright Widget Area on the right side,
drag standard Text widget from the left side to the widget area, 
enter your coyright text in the text field (you may leave the title field empty), something like:

	`
    &copy; 2013 Your Name. All rights reserved
	`

	P.S. please do not copy backticks - they are here to make this document compatible with Markdown syntax.

3. Go to Theme Customizer (Admin Panel Menu > Appearance > Customize) and see if you need to change any visual aspects of your site.

	- If you will choose to upload custom Header Logo (display it next to Site Title and Description), I recommend to size its height to 85px.

4. Next, open functions.php file in a text editor and find sections:

	- 5.9 - Add optional meta tags, scripts to head (2.2 - in child themes)

	- 12.0 - Other functions (3.0 - in child themes)

	- Check if you need to enable (uncomment) any of the functions there.

	- If you enabled human.txt meta tag, open human.txt file and update it with your information.

5. Make it look clean :) Personally I'm not a fan of displaying a bunch of meta data on index page or on archive pages. But I had to enable it to pass theme evaluation.  
However it is very easy to fix it. Open style.css and search for Tip30 then uncomment next CSS block to hide entry meta section (with author, categories, tags) in the Index page and archive listings.

6. If you want to use icon webfont for social networks (as you can see in the screenshot), use standard text widget in the Main Sidebar Widget 
(same as with Footer Copyright Widget) with text like this:

	```    
	<a href="http://address-to-about-me-page" class="icon-webfont icon-user" title="Contact me"></a> 
	<a href="http://address-to-facebook-account" class="icon-webfont icon-facebook" title="Facebook"></a> 
	<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/your-profile/" class="icon-webfont icon-linkedin" title="LinkedIn"></a> 
	<a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/your-wp-name" class="icon-webfont icon-wordpress" title="WordPress.org"></a> 
	<a href="http://twitter.com/your-twitter-handle" class="icon-webfont icon-twitter" title="Twitter"></a> 
	<a href="https://plus.google.com/your-g-plus-account-number" class="icon-webfont icon-googleplus" title="Google+" rel="author"></a> 
	<a href="http://github.com/your-github-name" class="icon-webfont icon-github-text" title="Github"></a>
	```

	P.S. please do not copy backticks - they are here to make this document compatible with Markdown syntax.

Tips and Tricks
===============

1. Tiny Forge is a mobile-first theme, that means main part of the style.css describes the overall mobile look.
Styles provided in media queries at the end of style.css introduce changes for other (larger) screen sizes. So don't be puzled ;)
Try to resize your browser window to see how the theme changes its look in relation to screen/browser window size.

2. If you want to remove a sidebar (have a full width site) - remove all widgets from the sidebar widget areas (Admin Panel Menu > Appearance > Widgets) and sidebar will disappear.

3. In the theme files I provided some examples on how to use icon webfont. CSS class names for other icons may be found at: http://shoestrap.org/downloads/elusive-icons-webfont/

4. If you want to have a rotating header images, upload several images (Admin Panel Menu > Appearance > Header > Select Image) and then select "Random: Show a different image on each page."

5. In case you need to display an image without any borders or shadows, include "no-border" class for the desired post image.

6. If your'e posting code in the post, first it should be escaped (use: http://www.elliotswan.com/postable/), then wrap it in <code> for inline usage and <pre><code> for blocks of code.

7. Don't know how to use LESS dynamic stylesheet language? Read css/readme.txt

- Theme becomes parent theme with several bundled child themes to have an example on how to extend it. 
  So it's still based on the Twenty Twelve, but I will not have to maintain the relation to it. 
  That became very important with evolution of HTML5 elements and the fact, that WordPress team is not interested in evolving older default themes.
- Bug fix: sidebar select element with very long value to overflow theme boundaries.

- Enhancement: updated .clear class - taken from Twitter Bootstrap (style.css).

Happy coding!
