Tiny Forge theme encompass all the best features of the default WordPress themes in one place, plus more usability and code improvements! 

It features elegant mobile-first HTML5 ready structure of Twenty Twelve, custom per-post headers and three footer widgets from Twenty Eleven, 
icon webfont support from Twenty Thirteen and Schema.org microdata format support. It's all there, you have everything in one neat package. 
Tiny Forge can be used as a learning tool or your own little web development "framework".

Quick start guide
=================

1. In WordPress Admin panel go to Appearance/Widgets, 
expand Footer Copyright Widget Area on the right side,
drag standard Text widget from the left side to the widget area, 
enter your coyright text in the text field (you may leave the title field empty), something like:

	`
    &copy; 2013 Your Name. All rights reserved
	`

	P.S. please do not copy backticks - they are here to make this document compatible with Markdown syntax.

2. If you want to use icon webfont for social networks (as you can see in the screenshot), use standard text widget in the Main Sidebar Widget (same as with Footer Copyright Widget) with text like this:

	```    
	<a href="http://address-to-about-me-page" class="icon-webfont icon-user" title="Contact me"></a> 
	<a href="http://address-to-facebook-account" class="icon-webfont icon-facebook" title="Facebook"></a> 
	<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/your-profile/" class="icon-webfont icon-linkedin" title="LinkedIn"></a> 
	<a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/your-wp-name" class="icon-webfont icon-wordpress" title="WordPress.org"></a> 
	<a href="http://twitter.com/your-twitter-handle" class="icon-webfont icon-twitter" title="Twitter"></a> 
	<a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/your-g-plus-account-number" class="icon-webfont icon-googleplus" title="Google+"></a> 
	<a href="http://github.com/your-github-name" class="icon-webfont icon-github-text" title="Github"></a>
	```

	P.S. please do not copy backticks - they are here to make this document compatible with Markdown syntax.

3. Next, open functions.php file in a text editor and find sections:

- 5.7 - Add optional meta tags, scripts to head (2.2 - in child themes)

- 12.0 - Other functions (3.0 - in child themes)

Check if you need to uncomment any of the functions there.

Tips and Tricks
===============

1. Tiny Forge is a mobile-first theme, that means main part of the style.css describes the overall mobile look.
Styles provided in media queries at the end of style.css introduce changes for other screen sizes. So don't be puzled ;)
Try to resize your browser window to see how the theme changes its look in relation to screen/browser window size.

2. In the theme files I provided some examples on how to use icon webfont. CSS class names for other icons may be found at: http://shoestrap.org/downloads/elusive-icons-webfont/

3. Don't know how to use LESS dynamic stylesheet language? Start reading here:	http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/htmlcss-tutorials/get-into-less-the-programmable-stylesheet-language/

4. In case you need to display an image without any borders or shadows, include "no-border" class for the desired post image.

Version history (changelog)
===========================

Tiny Forge v1.2 (2013-08-??)
----------------------------

	- Theme name change from 2012-XTended to Tiny Forge.
	- Theme becomes parent theme with several bundled child themes to have an example on how to extend it. 
	  So it's still based on the Twenty Twelve, but I will not have to maintain the relation to it. 
	  That became very important with evolution of HTML5 elements and the fact, that WordPress team is not interested in evolving older default themes.
	- Fixed the bug in sidebar that caused select element with very long value to overflow theme boundaries.
	- Added Twitter Bootstrap code class.
	- Added Twitter Bootstrap button styles: class="btn" class="btn btn-custom", check style.css file for more button styles.

2012-XTended v1.1 (2013-06-16)
------------------------------

	- Improve icon webfont rendering for a:hover state (style.css)
	- Updated .clear class - taken from Twitter Bootstrap (style.css)
	- Improved icon webfont ul and li styling in widgets (style.css)
	- Declutter post listing for index page and archives - top and bottom meta is visible only for single posts (content.php)
	- Added Tip13 - Add Twenty Thirteen search form to WordPress nav menu (functions.php, style.css)
	- Added theme support for default core markup for forms to output valid HTML5 (functions.php)
	- Non-existing HTML5 element hgroup replaced with div.site-branding (taken from _s) (header.php).</li>

2012-XTended v1.0 (2013-06-06)
------------------------------

	- Initial release
